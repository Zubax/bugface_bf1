# DroneCode Probe

The DroneCode Probe is a generic JTAG / SWD + UART console adapter compatible with most ARM Cortex based
designs and in particular with hardware maintained by the DroneCode project.
It is a low-cost design with a BOM value around $10.00â€‹ and supported on all operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac OS).

## Key Features / Added Value

- Firmware compatible to the Black Magic probe.
- Does not require OpenOCD or other software to run GDB on Windows, Linux or Mac OS.
- Better setup / usage experience compared to other JTAG probes
- Integrated 3.3V serial adapter for console access
- Solder-free support for common DroneCode cabling options:
  - ARM Mini 10pos standard header
  - DCD-S: DroneCode Debug connector small
  - DCD-M: DroneCode Debug connector medium
  - 6-pos DF13 console cable (Pixhawk 1.x)
